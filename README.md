# useFlix

**useFlix** is a small React project created as part of a React course. It’s a movie tracking application where users can browse a list of movies, mark them as watched, and view basic statistics like average ratings and runtime.

The original project, **usePopcorn**, was implemented entirely in a single component. With **useFlix**, my focus was on **refactoring the code into smaller, reusable components**, simulating a collaborative team workflow and improving maintainability.

**Key Highlights & Learnings:**

- Breaking down a large component into modular, reusable components
- Managing state effectively with React hooks (`useState`)
- Mapping structured data to a dynamic UI
- Implementing conditional rendering and toggleable sections
- Building a clean and maintainable code structure

All movie and watched data is currently static and stored locally in the app.

This project demonstrates my ability to write **clean, organized, and scalable React code**, and reflects an understanding of **component-based architecture**—skills essential for real-world frontend development.
